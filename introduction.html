    Hi,

    My name is Michaela and I just finished my studies in engineering and started my first job.

    Suddenly, I was confronted with topics like employee shares, retirement plans, investments and

    similar topics, which I fiercely tried to avoid in the past.
    </p>
<p>As I realized how important these topics are

    for my future, I was looking for a tool helping me to understand them interactively.

    While I am still not reading financial news, I now have a much broader understanding of finance

    thanks to edufiy.
</p>
<p>Its tutorials allowed me to design my personal financial journey. As my bank

    simultaneously got all necessary information, we could define my personal investment strategy

    together, without long annoying meetings.

    I was thrilled how easy this journey was.
